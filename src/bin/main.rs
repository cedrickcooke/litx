Same paragraph: {$t$}.

New paragraph.

{h1 "Introduction"}
This is a plaintext paragraph.
These lines have not been separated by a blank line.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

This line is separated by a blank line on either side.

{h2 "Sub-header"}
On this line we have some funky styling, like inline math: {$1+2$}, and {emph "italics"}.
There is also an escaped newline: \n, outside of an expression.
Even worse, what if we have a newline in a word? Foo\nbar.

{h2 "Danger zone"}
I think this might actually break things. Is this fine!? What about this: $25.
